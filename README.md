# SimpleCompiler

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a compiler/interpreter that helps learn the basics of compilers and assembly. It parses mathematical expressions and generates assembly code for the 68000 processor.

## Goal
The project was created to study compiler principles. In the future, I plan to add new features and improvements.

## Features
- Parses simple mathematical expressions.
- Generates assembly code for expressions.
- Uses a stack for performing operations.
