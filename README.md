# SimpleCompiler

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a compiler/interpreter that helps learn the basics of compilers and assembly. It parses mathematical expressions and generates assembly code for the 68000 processor.

## Goal
The project was created to study compiler principles. In the future, I plan to add new features and improvements.

## Features
**Mathematical Expression Parsing:** The parser handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Assignment Handling:** It processes variable assignments and translates them into corresponding instructions.
- **Whitespace Management:** It correctly handles spaces and line breaks to ensure that input is processed cleanly.
